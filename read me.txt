PkmnIsolatedEncounter created by Dario B. aka Lord of D.

The Isolated Encounter Method was coined by the YouTuber 'Austin John Plays'.
For reference/tutorial watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9zO9LiFF2Y.


How to use:
Simply enter the name of any Pokemon that is available in Scarlet and Violet.
This program calculates which areas have the least amount of matches for that Pokemon.
The result is saved in a text file.
You can change the path the text file is stored in simply by putting it in 'path.txt'.
If 'path.txt' is kept empty any text files will be saved in the 'Text Files' folder.


Disclaimer:
This program uses data from https://serebii.net.
Since their website is subject to change this program might not work in the future.
Also this program might not work for any Pokemon added through DLCs or updates.
I will try to keep this as up to date as possible.
